6. Did you design your app with a particular type of user in mind? If so, whom?

I designed my app for all types of users. I wanted anyone from any background/race/age to be able
to use this app.

7. Did you design your app specifically for iOS or Android, or both?

I designed this app more towards iOS, however it can be used on Android as well.

8. How can a person log overnight sleep in your app? Why did you choose to support logging overnight sleep in this way?

A person can log overnight sleep by using a scrollbar to select when they woke up and another scrollbar
to select when they went to sleep. I chose to log sleep this way because a user can log it regardless of what day it was.

9. How can a person log sleepiness during the day in your app? Why did you choose to support logging sleepiness in this way?

There is a separate page for them to log their sleepiness during the day apart from when they woke up and went to bed.
I chose this way because people may feel different throughout the day so they might want to choose their overall feeling.

10. How can a person view the data they logged in your app? Why did you choose to support viewing logged data in this way?

There is a separate tab to show their history. I chose to show it in card style because it is the easiest way for a user to view data.
There is a clear view of the date and how many hours of sleep they got.

11. Which feature choose--using a native device resource, backing up logged data, or both?

I chose backing up logged data. I used firebase to log and store my data.

12. If you used a native device resource, what feature did you add? How does this feature change the app's experience for a user?

I did not use a native device resource.

13. If you backed up logged data, where does it back up to?

The data is backed up into a firebase realtime database.

14. How does your app implement or follow principles of good mobile design?

The app maintains a set color scheme with intuitive components for user input with little confusion.
This app also allows the user to delete a log if they entered info wrong and update information if needed.
